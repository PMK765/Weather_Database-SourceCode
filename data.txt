0000PST 2359PST 0 0 0.00K 0.00K Drought
Long term drought impacts continued to decrease through the month of January, as a series of strong atmospheric river storms brought very wet conditions. This continued the wet pattern which began in the Fall; and resulted in significant improvement to the drought situation, especially to the northern Sierra. The northern Sierra had the third wettest January on record (8 Station Index). At the end of January, Lake Shasta was 115% of normal, Lake Oroville was 123%, Folsom Lake was 80%, and Don Pedro was 129%. New Melones Reservoir improved, though continued to lag behind the other significant area reservoirs at 71% of normal. The U.S. Drought Monitor showed significant improvement over the area, with only the northern San Joaquin Valley in D1 Moderate Drought, and portions of the Motherlode in D0 Abnormally Dry, Those areas were in D3 Extreme Drought and D2 Severe Drought in December. All of the rest of interior Northern California, including the northern Sierra, the Sacramento Valley, the Delta, and the southern Cascades were in the 'None' category by the end of January.
Groundwater aquifers continued to recharge more slowly than the surface reservoirs, though the DWR Water Data Library showed signs of improvement in some areas. Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the entire state of California January 17, 2014 and this continued to be in effect. Governor Brown issued an executive order on May 9, 2016 that built on temporary statewide emergency water restrictions to establish longer-term water conservation measures, including permanent monthly water use reporting, new permanent water use standards in California communities and banned clearly wasteful practices such as hosing off sidewalks, driveways and other hardscapes. Local emergency proclamations remain for Colusa, Calaveras, El Dorado, Glenn, San Joaquin, Shasta, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tuolumne, and Yuba counties. Plumas County no longer had a Local Emergency Proclamation. The cities of Live Oak (Sutter County), Lodi (San Joaquin County), Manteca (San Joaquin County), Portola (Plumas County), Ripon (San Joaquin County), and West Sacramento (Yolo County) continued to have local emergency proclamations . Drought task forces remain in Lake, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Tuolumne, and Yolo counties to coordinate response to the drought.

Two strong storms brought a range of significant weather impacts to northern interior California. The first storm was very wet and warm, the second not quite as wet but cooler with lower snow levels. Both storms brought strong, damaging winds.  The heavy rain brought widespread flooding of small streams and rivers, with some flooding of main stem rivers, mountain snow many feet deep, and numerous trees down on roads, vehicles, and homes. Many roads, including major highways such as Interstate 80, were shut down due to mudslides, heavy snow, flooding, washouts or avalanche suppression.  EF0 tornadoes were reported at Lincoln and Natomas. Other significant impacts include numerous accidents due to slippery roads, evacuations and rescues due to flooding.

0000PST 2359PST 0 0 Drought
The California drought strength lessened over during the month of January, 2017. Fresno received 5.50 of precipitation and Bakersfield received 2.76 precipitation during the month. Fresno had much above normal precipitation with 3.31 above normal. Bakersfield had significantly above normal precipitation with 1.60 above the normal precipitation amounts. Above normal precipitation amounts did allow for continued improvement on drought conditions with an increase in soil moisture and significant reservoir recharge. The U.S. Drought Monitor continued to report drought conditions across the entire Central California region. However, several reductions in the drought category occurred during the month. The first happened on January 10th across the northern most portions of the area due to above normal rainfall. The trend continued the following week across the Sierra Nevada Range north of Sequoia National Park. This too was due to above normal precipitation and a good amount of snow pack. Valley locations were still experiencing many dry wells even with the above normal precipitation. However, by the 24th valley locations too had a reduction in category as streams and lakes began to fill due to the wet month. Only a small area in southwestern Kern county had the Extreme (D3) category left, though most of the San Joaquin Valley were still under Severe Drought (D2). The month ended with only the San Emigdio Mountains remaining under Extreme Drought (D3).

An 80 ft oak tree fell on a mini van killing the driver. Saturated soils were likely an influencing factor. Winds were light at the time. A series of troughs and associated Pacific fronts swung through the region between the 5th and 9th of January, bringing largely beneficial rains, high elevation snow, and strong inland winds. Rainfall west of the mountains caused some minor urban flooding, but overall impacts were limited by low rain rates over an extended period. Rain totals ranged from 6-7 inches along the coastal slopes to 1-2 inches near the coast. Peak westerly wind gusts along the desert slopes were mostly in the 45-65 mph range, though a surfacing mountain wave in Burns Canyon produced a very impressive 107 mph wind gust.
